Roadmap
===========

StackStorm is new and under active development. We are opening it early to engage community, get  feedback, and refine directions, and welcome contributions. Below are key next items we see as top priorities.

* **RBAC:** Role based access control for actions, triggers, rules, and datastore keys.
* **Web UI advanced functionality:** visual workflow design representation, drag&drop workflow designer.
* **Scale improvements:** refactoring and fixes to scale out better to manage large volumes of events and actions.
* **Pack management:** Improve support for pack creation lifecycle. REST API to manage and configure packs installed in the system. Smoother integration with community content.
* **Reliability:** Focus on availability of services and improve system reliability.
* **Tags:** tag any resources, to handle actions, triggers and rules as their number grows to hundreds.
* **Action Output Structure Definition**: enable optional definition of action payload, so that it can be introspected and used when passing data between actions in worfklows.
* **Database:** move away from Mongo to Postgres and/or MySQL.
* **Pluggable runners:** We have heard that a Ruby runner would be great.
* **Datastore:**  Hierarchical, pluggable and secure datastore to bring together all the gnarly config and key spread in operations environments.
* **Bugs and smaller improvements**
* **Documentation:** generate REST API docs.
* **More integration packs:** push more content to the community to help work with most common and widely used tool. Tell us if there is tool you love and think we should integrate with or better yet write a pack yourself.

See :doc:`/changelog` for details on what is done.
